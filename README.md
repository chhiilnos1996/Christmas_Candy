# Christmas_Candy
My very first C++ final project as a beginner when I was a freshman in college.

Game Introduction : This game is inspired by zuma (http://www.playbubblez.com/games/zuma/), but a cuter vesion called christmas candy. A candy emerges from the middle of the screen every few seconds and goes to the direction where the player clicks. The player should click the directon with more candies with the same color. If n balls (n>3) comes together, they eliminates themselves and the player gets nn100 points! But when the player fails to eliminate candies and candies rolls to the exit, the game is over.
